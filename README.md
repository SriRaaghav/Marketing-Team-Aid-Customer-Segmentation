# Marketing-Team-Aid-Customer-Segmentation

### Customer Segmentation Service (RFM + K-Means)

Processed customer dataset (2,240×29), engineered spending, tenure, RFM categories to
identify VIP segments (~15%).

Applied K-Means clustering, optimized cluster count via Elbow Method and Silhouette Score,
and visualized 4 well-separated segments using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

Created marketing personas: young low-spending online buyers, high-income luxury
spenders, offline loyal shoppers.
